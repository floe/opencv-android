The OpenCV SDK for Android as a ready-to-go module for Android Studio 3.0

Currently, the OpenCV SDK for Android still contains all code as Eclipse projects,
which has been deprecated for a long time in favor of Android Studio.

This repository simply contains the resulting module from a clean import of the legacy Eclipse project.

(Of course, the clean solution would be to have the OpenCV build process output Android Studio modules right away. 
But I don't have time for that ;-)
